Factors

If the last update operation succeeded, this function returns 0 (zero), otherwise it returns one of the following values:

48: The update failed because it contained an invalid duplicate key.
49: The update failed because it contained an invalid null key.
50: The update failed because it contained all null keys.
51: The update failed because the record had already been modified.
52: The update failed because the record had already been deleted.
53: The update failed because of a trigger error.
-1: Other errors.
Every time the file variable is moved or changed (for example, a new record is inserted), the return value of this function is reset to 0.
