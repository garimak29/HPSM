function writeToFile( path, binary, object )
{

//print( "Writing " + path + " to file..." );

var output = writeFile( path, binary, object );

//print( "The number of bytes written to file was: " + output );

return output;
}

function writeLocations()
{

filePath = "/download/ITAM/SM7locations.txt"; //Path on Server
isBinary = null;

var temp_arr = "";

var locs = new SCFile("location");

var theXMLDate = new XMLDate(new Date());
var todaysDate = theXMLDate.getSCDateTimeString();
var query = "sysmodtime>'"+todaysDate+ "' - '2 00:00:00'";
//var query = "true";

rc1 = locs.doSelect(query);

if (rc1 == RC_SUCCESS ) {
do {
temp_arr+=locs.location;
temp_arr+="\n";
}
while (locs.getNext() == RC_SUCCESS);
