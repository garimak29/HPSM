  c. Login to SQL Server thru client (SQL Management Studio with credential: SQL Server Authn. and USERNAME/PSWD : sa/ XXXX) 

  d. Create new database (i.e. HPSM)

  e. Check the user 'sa' have sysadmin right (Goto server's security tab -> Properties ) ALSO change the default DB to newly created Db i.e.'HPSM'
