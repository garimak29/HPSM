The link menu is in Menu manager->tailoring->tailoring tools. there you have to print name (e.x probsummary - incidents table). The first column Source field is for specifiyng the field name to which you want data to be copied. Target file column is column for specifiyng table name from which you are gpoing to copy data. Target field column is field name from target tab;le from which you want data to copy. Most of the links in SM are complex. That means that after creating such record you have to go to the option menu (triangle in the right corner) and choose Select line there Important: Before selecting the line you have to mark record to which you want to create a complex link. In the select line window in source and target fields you have to specify which exact table fields you want to copy, because if you dont do that it will copy all the fields with the same name (so it may copy data which you dont want to be copied.) in the case of complex link you can write several fields that will be populated after the first one (e.x by linking contact name form contacts table you can specify in Select line that you want to copy also his phone number, room and other parameters).
