the "Look for" drop down appears because of following reasons
1. In the Object check for 3 things :
   a. Profile variable - $L.env in this check for the views .
			type in rad debugger - 	d $L.env
						d views in $L.env
			check if the condition applied is true or not . If not then this might b one of the reasons why the table name is not showing up in the list . 
if it is comming null check in fc in priveleges for views 

NOTE: remember , these commands are to be typed when you open the table . example when you search for operator table .

   b. check for search config. allow search condition should be true

2. check for profile application - this plays a very imp role in fetching the record

3. check for variables $L.advFind.table .
